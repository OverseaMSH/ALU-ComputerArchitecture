## Project Overview

The ALU designed in this project performs several fundamental arithmetic and logic operations on binary data inputs. It is capable of handling operations typically required in CPU design and computer architecture studies.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**  
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Exponentiation (Power)

- **Advanced Mathematical Functions:**  
  - Square Root  
  - Logarithm (base 2 or natural logarithm as implemented)

- **Logical Operations:**  
  - AND  
  - OR  

- **Input/Output Width:**  
  - Supports 8-bit inputs (can be extended as needed)

- **Operation Selection:**  
  - Uses function select signals to determine which operation to perform.

## Tools and Environment

- **Language:** VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)  
- **Simulation & Testing:** Active-HDL simulator  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Usage

The project includes the VHDL source files along with testbench files to simulate and verify the correct functionality of the ALU operations.
